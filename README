= Deadlock Retry

Deadlock retry allows the database adapter (currently only tested with the
MySQLAdapter) to retry transactions that fall into deadlock. It will retry
such transactions three times before finally failing.

This capability is automatically added to ActiveRecord. No code changes or otherwise are required.

== Installation

Add it to your Rails application via Bundler via:

  gem 'deadlock_retry', :git => 'git://github.com/heaps/deadlock_retry.git'
